âœ… Day 18 â€“ Helm Lifecycle Hooks
Hooks are special lifecycle events (e.g., pre-install, post-install) defined in your templates.

You can use them to:

Run DB migrations before deployment

Cleanup after uninstall

Defined using annotations like:

annotations:
  "helm.sh/hook": pre-install

âœ… Day 19 â€“ Helm Upgrade and Rollback
helm upgrade myapp . â€” updates your release with new values/templates.

helm rollback myapp 1 â€” rolls back to revision 1.

Use helm history myapp to see all revisions.

You can force upgrade with --force or keep old values with --reuse-values.

âœ… Day 20 â€“ Helm Testing Framework
Helm lets you define tests as Kubernetes jobs.

Defined inside templates/tests/:

annotations:
  "helm.sh/hook": test
Run tests with:

helm test <release-name>

âœ… Day 21 â€“ Helm with Dependencies (Charts of Charts)
Use Chart.yaml to define dependencies:

dependencies:
  - name: redis
    version: 14.0.0
    repository: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
Then run:

helm dependency update
It downloads subcharts into charts/ directory.

âœ… Day 22 â€“ Helm Best Practices
Follow naming conventions: use fullnameOverride and nameOverride.

Keep templates modular.

Store values.yaml per environment.

Use helm lint to catch syntax errors.

âœ… Day 23 â€“ Helm and CI/CD Integration
Helm is easily integrated with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.

Example GitHub Actions step:

- name: Deploy with Helm
  run: helm upgrade --install myapp ./chart --values values-prod.yaml
âœ… Day 24 â€“ Creating Your Own Helm Chart Repository
Use helm package to package your chart.

Generate index.yaml using:

helm repo index . --url <your-host-url>
Host .tgz and index.yaml on GitHub Pages.

Add the repo with:

helm repo add myrepo <url>
