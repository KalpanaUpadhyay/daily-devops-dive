What is HELM?

Helm is like apt (for Ubuntu) or npm (for Node.js), but for Kubernetes. It helps you manage complex Kubernetes applications by packaging them into reusable units called Charts.

⚙️ What it does:
Installs apps on Kubernetes (e.g., Cassandra, Redis, NGINX)

Manages configuration (values.yaml)

Helps upgrade/downgrade or roll back app versions

Handles dependency management

📦 Example:
You want to deploy Cassandra on Kubernetes. Instead of writing a bunch of YAML files manually, you do:

helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install my-cassandra bitnami/cassandra

Boom — Cassandra is deployed with sane defaults, secrets, StatefulSets, services, etc.



🛢️ Apache Cassandra — “Distributed NoSQL Database”

🔍 What it is:
Cassandra is a highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database designed to handle massive amounts of data across many nodes, with no single point of failure.

🧠 Key Features:
NoSQL → stores data in key-value or wide-column format (not tables with joins like in SQL)

Peer-to-peer architecture

High write throughput

Fault-tolerant and decentralized

Used by Netflix, Instagram, Reddit, etc.

📈 Use cases:
Time-series data

IoT data ingestion

Real-time analytics

When you need 24/7 uptime and massive scalability

🧩 Together:
You might use Helm to deploy Cassandra on Kubernetes easily. Helm simplifies deployment, and Cassandra gives you the power of a fault-tolerant database that can scale horizontally.
