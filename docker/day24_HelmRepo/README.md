🌐 What is a Helm Repository?
A Helm repository is a place where you store and share your packaged Helm charts (.tgz files). Tools like helm repo add and helm install work with it just like a package manager.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide
✅ 1. Package Your Chart
Assuming your chart folder is named my-microservice/:

helm package my-microservice
This creates:

my-microservice-0.1.0.tgz

✅ 2. Create an Index File
Create or update the index.yaml that Helm uses to find charts:

helm repo index . --url https://kalpana.github.io/helm-charts
Here:

. → current directory

--url → base URL where .tgz and index.yaml will be hosted (e.g., GitHub Pages)

✅ 3. Host on GitHub Pages
Create a GitHub repo: helm-charts

Push these files:

my-microservice-0.1.0.tgz

index.yaml

Go to repo → Settings → Pages → Deploy from main branch / root
(it will be served at: https://<your_username>.github.io/helm-charts/)

✅ 4. Add the Repo Locally
Once hosted:

helm repo add kalpana-charts https://kalpana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
Now install from anywhere:

helm install myapp kalpana-charts/my-microservice
✅ 5. (Optional) Automate it
Use GitHub Actions to auto-build index.yaml and upload charts when you push a new chart. Let me know if you want help setting that up!

🔁 Recap:

Step	What You Did
📦	Packaged Helm charts
🗂️	Created index.yaml
🌍	Hosted charts on GitHub Pages
➕	Added your own repo with helm repo add
This is production-ready practice — companies maintain their own private Helm repos this way (or via ChartMuseum/Harbor).
