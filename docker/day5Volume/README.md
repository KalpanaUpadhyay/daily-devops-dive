Weâ€™ll modify yesterdayâ€™s setup so that our app:

Saves the counter to a local file

Uses a volume to persist that data even if the container stops or is rebuilt

This creates a named volume (counter_data) that maps to /data in the container, which the app uses to store the counter file.


OUTPUT :


Visit: http://localhost:5000

ðŸ’¡ Refresh the page â†’ count increases
ðŸ’¥ Stop the container and rerun â†’ counter is not lost
