🎯 Testing, Validating & Linting Your Helm Charts – making sure your Helm charts are correct before deploying them!

🧪 Why Chart Testing Matters
Before deploying:

You want to catch template errors

Validate against Kubernetes

Ensure repeatability and avoid production surprises

🔧 1. helm lint – Syntax + Best Practices Check
✅ Run:
helm lint <chart-directory>

This checks:

Template syntax

Missing values.yaml

Invalid keys in templates

Basic best practices

Example:
helm lint mychart/

🟢 Output:

==> Linting mychart/
1 chart(s) linted, no failures
❌ Errors might include:

Invalid YAML

Unresolved values

Missing metadata

🔍 2. helm template – Render and Preview Without Installing
✅ Run:
helm template <release-name> <chart-directory> -f custom-values.yaml
📄 Output: Full rendered YAML sent to stdout — this helps you verify before deployment.

🧪 3. Helm Test (Advanced – Optional for Now)
Helm supports:

helm test <release-name>
But only if your chart defines a Kubernetes test Pod (e.g., Job or Pod with helm.sh/hook: test).

🛠️ Skip this for now unless you're deploying critical services with automated test pods.

🧰 Bonus: Helm Lint in CI/CD
In a GitHub Action or Jenkins pipeline:

helm lint ./charts/mychart
helm template mychart ./charts/mychart -f values.yaml
This gives you confidence in PRs before merging.

Summary Table:

Command	Purpose
helm lint	Check for errors and best practices
helm template	Render and verify output YAML
helm test (optional)	Run Kubernetes-level integration tests
