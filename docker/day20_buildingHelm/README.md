📚 Day 20: Building and Hosting Your Own Helm Chart Repository 🚀
When you create Helm charts, you can host them just like a software repository so that others (or you yourself) can easily install them using:

helm repo add <name> <url>
helm install <release-name> <name>/<chart-name>

🏗️ Step-by-Step Guide
1. 🛠️ Package Your Helm Chart
You need to create a .tgz file (compressed archive) of your chart.

helm package my-first-chart
✅ It will create a file like:

my-first-chart-0.1.0.tgz

2. 📄 Create an Index File
You need an index.yaml that lists all available charts.

helm repo index .
✅ It creates an index.yaml based on .tgz files in the current folder.

3. 🚀 Host the Files
You can host:

On a simple web server (like Nginx, GitHub Pages, AWS S3, etc.)

Example: GitHub Pages (easy and free!)

If using GitHub Pages:

Push .tgz and index.yaml to a public GitHub repository.

Enable GitHub Pages on that repo (Settings → Pages → Branch: main → /root).

Then your chart repo URL will be:

php-template:

https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

4. ➕ Add Your New Repo to Helm
On any system:

helm repo add my-repo https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
✅ Now Helm knows your charts!

5. 📥 Install from Your Repo
helm install my-release my-repo/my-first-chart
✅ This will install the chart like it's from a professional Helm Repository!
