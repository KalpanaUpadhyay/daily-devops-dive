âœ… Already Covered
Docker: Images, Containers, Dockerfile, Compose.

Kubernetes: Pods, Deployments, Services, Volumes, ConfigMaps, Probes.

Helm: Charts, Values, Templates, Hooks, CI/CD integration.

Monitoring: Grafana (OSS), Prometheus (basics), RabbitMQ metrics.

Python-based health checks.

GitHub Actions (basic).

Some Linux fundamentals via Docker/K8s usage.

ðŸ”„ Whatâ€™s Next (To Become Job-Ready or Advance)
ðŸŸ¨ Intermediate Level
Topic	Why Important
Prometheus Setup	Collect metrics from K8s and apps (RabbitMQ, Node Exporter).
Alertmanager	Create alert rules for critical conditions (e.g., consumer count = 0).
Log Management (EFK/ELK)	Elasticsearch + Fluentd + Kibana to centralize logs.
Secrets Management	HashiCorp Vault or SealedSecrets in K8s.
Docker Multi-stage builds	Optimize image size for prod builds.
Pod Autoscaling	Configure HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler).
K8s Network Policies	Secure internal pod communication.

ðŸŸ© Advanced Level (Optional but Excellent to Know)
Topic	Benefit
Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd)	Fine-grained control of traffic, observability.
ArgoCD or FluxCD	GitOps-style deployments.
Terraform (Infra as Code)	Manage K8s clusters or cloud infra via code.
Kafka + Monitoring	Extend message queue understanding beyond RabbitMQ.
Custom Helm Plugin	Build internal automation tools.
K8s Operators (using Helm or SDK)	Manage complex stateful apps (like IMS) in K8s.


ðŸ§© Optional Tools (based on my interest in telecom/backends)
Tool/Tech	Relevance
OpenTelemetry	Unified tracing/metrics/logging, useful in telecom infra.
GCP / AWS Basics	Hosting K8s clusters or using managed services.
Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD	Expand beyond GitHub Actions.
Kustomize	K8s YAML customization without Helm.
Container Security (Trivy, Clair)	Scan Docker images before pushing.

ðŸ“… Suggested Next Steps
Learn Prometheus + Alertmanager Setup â†’ Full monitoring solution.

Set up EFK Stack â†’ Understand how to handle log pipelines.

Create a GitHub Actions pipeline to deploy Helm chart on push.

Mini project:

Deploy RabbitMQ in K8s using Helm.

Expose metrics to Prometheus.

Visualize in Grafana.

Alert when no consumers are connected.
